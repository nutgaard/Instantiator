# Instantiator

Tired of manually setup test data of Kotlin data classes or POJOs? Instantiator creates Instances of any class for you
so that you can focus on writing tests instead of spending time and effort to set up test data.

This is not a mocking library. When talking about Instantiator can create an instance of any class for you, I'm
referring on data class or POJOs, not mock functionality.

It doesn't use any black magic. It uses reflection and invokes the public primary constructors. If there is no public
primary constructor available, then Instantiator cannot instantiate it.

## Dependencies

```
testImplementation 'com.hannesdorfmann.instantiator:instantiator:0.3.0'
```

or `SNAPSHOT` (directly built from main branch):

```
testImplementation 'com.hannesdorfmann.instantiator:instantiator:0.3.1-SNAPSHOT'
```

## Usage

Assuming you have some data structures like this

```kotlin
data class Person(
    val id: String,
    val firstname: String,
    val lastname: String,
    val age: Int,
    val gender: Gender
)

enum class Gender {
    MALE,
    FEMALE,
    UNDEFINED
}

fun computeFullname(p: Person): String {
    return "${p.firstname} ${p.lastname}"
}
```

And you want to write some (unit) tests to test some functionality you often have to manually set up some object
instances just for testing. This is where Instantiator comes in: it creates such instances for you.

```kotlin
@Test
fun someTest() {
    val person: Person =
        instance() // instance() is Instantiator's API. It creates a new instance of Person with random values. 

    // Now that you have some random Person object 
    // you can do with it whatever you want
    val expected = "${person.firstname} ${person.lastname}"
    val fullname = computeFullname(person)
    assertEquals(expected, fullname)
}
```

Bonus:
if you want to get an instance for each subclass of a sealed class hierarchy use `instantiateSealedSubclasses()` like
this:

```kotlin
sealed class Root
data class A(i: Int) : Root()
data class B(i: Int) : Root()


sealed class NestedRoot : Root()
data class N1(i: Int) : NestedRoot()


val subclassesInstances: List<Root> = instantiateSealedSubclasses()
println(subclasses) // contains 3 instances and prints  "A, B, N1"
```

## Supported use cases

Type | Support | Note and default behavior description
--- | --- | ---
`data class` | ✅️ | invokes primary constructor and fills parameter with random values. This works incl. other types: i.e. `data class Foo( id : Int, bar : Bar)`. Instantiator will also instantiate a `Bar` instance to eventually instantiate `Foo`
`class` | ✅️ | works the same as `data class`.
`sealed class` | ✅ | randomly creates an instance by randomly picking a subclass of the sealed class hierarchy and then instantiates this one (meaning what is written in the rows above about support for `data class` or `class` still holds). Additionally, if you want to have a full list of instances of all subclasses of a sealed class hierarchy use `val subclassesInstances : List<SomeSealedClass> = instantiateSealedSubclasses()`.
`sealed interface` | ✅ | works exactly the same way as `sealed class` (see above).
`object` | ✅ | Objects / Singleton are supported and it will return exactly that one object instance that already exists (not instantiate via generics another instance of the same object so having 2 with different memory address).
`interface` | ❌️ | Not supported out of the box because by using reflections there is no straight forward way (apart from class path scanning which is not implemented at the moment) to find out which class implements an interface.
`abstract class`| ❌️ | same reason as for interface (see above).
`enum` | ✅️ | fully supported. It randomly picks one case and returns it.
`List` | ✅️ | `List` and `MutableList` are supported in class constructors. i.e. in instance of AdressBook can be instantiated: `data class AdressBook(val persons : List<Person>)`  but you can also directly request an instance with `val persons : List<Person> = instance()`.
`Set` | ✅️ | `Set` and `MutableSet` are supported in class constructors. i.e. in instance of AdressBook can be instantiated: `data class AdressBook(val persons : Set<Person>)` but you can also directly request an instance with `val persons : Set<Person> = instance()`
`Map` | ✅️ | `Map` and `MutableMap` are supported in class constructors. i.e. in instance of PhoneBook can be instantiated: `data class PhoneBook(val phoneNumbers : Map<Person, PhoneNumber>)` but you can also directly request an instance with `val phoneBook : Map<Person, PhoneNumber>> = instance()`
`Collection` | ✅️ | `Collection` and `MutableCollection` are supported in class constructors. i.e. in instance of AdressBook can be instantiated: `data class AdressBook(val persons : Collection<Person>)`  but you can also directly request an instance with `val persons : Collection<Person>> = instance()`
`Pair` | ✅️ | supported in class constructors and directly in request
`Triple` | ✅️ | supported in class constructors and directly in request
`Int`  | ✅️ | random number is returned
`Long`  | ✅️ | random number is returned
`Float`  | ✅️ | random number is returned
`Double`  | ✅️ | random number is returned
`Short`  | ✅️ | random number is returned
`String`  | ✅️ | random string with default length of 10 characters is returned. Pool of chars that is used to compute random string is `a..z` + `A..Z` + `0..9`.
`Char`  | ✅️ | random char is returned from the following pool of chars: `a..z` + `A..Z` + `0..9`.
`Boolean`  | ✅️ | randomly returns true or false
`Byte` | ✅️ | randomly creates one byte and returns it

## Configuration

You can configure Instantiator by passing a `InstantiatorConfig` instance as parameter
to `instance(config : InstantiatorConfig)` or `instantiateSealedSubclasses(config : InstantiatorConfig)`.

Some settings that you can set:

- `InstantiatorConfig.useDefaultArguments`: Set it to `true` if you want that the default arguments of constructor
  parameters are used if provided. For example, given `data class MyClass(val id : Int, val name : String = "Barbra")`,
  if `config.useDefaultArguments = true`
  then the parameter`name` of any instance will be `name="Barbra"` and only `id` which has no default argument set will
  be filled with random value. Default value of the default config is
  that `InstantiatorConfig.useDefaultArguments = true`.
- `InstantiatorConfig.useNull`: Set it to `true` if for constructor parameters that can be `null`,
  `null` is actually the value. for example, given `data class MyClass(val id : Int?)`, if `config.useNull = true`
  then instance will look like `MyClass( id = null)`. If `config.useNull = false` then nullable parameters will have non
  null values i.e. `MyClass ( id = 123)`. Default value of default config is `InstantiatorConfig.useNull = true`
- `InstantiatorConfig.random`: By setting it to a seeded `Random` you can recreate objects between tests and environments.
  For example by setting it to `Random(0)`

In case a constructor parameter is both, nullable and has a default value, then the default config uses the
default value for the parameter. Example:

```kotlin
class Foo(val i: Int? = 42)

val foo = instance<Foo>()

println(foo.i) // prints 42
```

## Custom `InstanceFactory`

`InstantiatorConfig` takes as a constructor parameter `vararg factories: InstanceFactory`. An `InstanceFactory` is used
to create an instance in case a unsupported type needs to be instantiated (see Supported use cases table above) or if
you want to override how primitive types are instantiated.

```kotlin
class MyIntInstanceFactory : InstantiatorConfig.InstanceFactory<Int> {
    override val type: KType = Int::class.createType()
    override fun createInstance(random: Random): Int = 42
}

val config = InstantiatorConfig(MyIntInstanceFactory())

val i = instance<Int>(config) // i == 42 and all other ints will be 42 when using this config
```

`InstantiatorConfig` is immutable. You can add an `InstanceFactory` with
the `val newConfig : InstantiatorConfig = instantiatorConfig.add(myCustomFactoy)`
